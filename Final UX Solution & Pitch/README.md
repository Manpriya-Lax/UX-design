Design Solution & Final Pitch

Building on Assignment 2, this assignment involved developing and presenting a final design solution using **Figma**:

-  **Design Problem Story Arc**: Presented the user journey, needs, and goals.
-  **Task Flow Diagrams**: Mapped out core user interactions.
-  **Design Mockups**: Created visually refined static screens in Figma.
-  **Design Rationale**: Justified decisions using UX principles and usability best practices.

The final deliverable was an in-class pitch (5â€“8 minutes) demonstrating how the solution addresses user needs while meeting client expectations.
