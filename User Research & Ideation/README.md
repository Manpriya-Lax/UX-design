User Research & Ideation

This phase focused on developing a deep understanding of users through qualitative research:

-  **Brief Breakdown**: A real-world design problem was selected from the options provided on Blackboard.
-  **User Interviews**: Primary research was conducted to gather insights from target users.
-  **Research Analysis**: Data was synthesised to identify key themes, behaviours, and pain points.
-  **Ideation**: Brainstormed potential solutions aligned with user needs and project goals.

This process reinforced the importance of empathy and validation in the design process.
